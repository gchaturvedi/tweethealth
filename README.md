TweetHealth
===========
TweetHealth is a small Django web app made for fun and as a learning exercise.  The main 
purpose of the app is to determine your health (lifestyle) via your tweets from Twitter

## Technology Stack
- Python 2.7
- Django 1.4.1
- Postgresql (Although this app doesn't use models, Django still depends on a database backend for the unit tests runner)
- jQuery 1.8.0 / Javascript (These are under /media/ which is standard practice in Django apps)
- Twitter Bootstrap (HTML/CSS library also under /media/)

## Heroku Deployment		
The app has been deployed to heroku, visit it at http://tweethealth.herokuapp.com/

It's on a free dyno, so it could take up to 30 seconds to load up.
